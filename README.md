# Electron-Webpacker (epack for short)

Electron-Webpacker, or `epack` for short, is a lightweight build tool for Electron + Webpack projects. A toolkit that helps you setup and run Electron + Webpack projects fast removing all the unnecessary infrastructure you'd do manually.

In a nutshell it does these three things

* Initializes the base files and folder structure for an Electron + Webpack project. (see init)
* Builds Webpack configuration files for both main and renderer processes.
* Runs Electron and webpack-dev-server

These are just highlights, it's a lot more complex under the hood. It uses the CLI to run `webpack-cli`
`webpack-dev-server` `electron` `electron-builder` `npm`. It will search the environment PATH for an available
version of these tools. If not found, it will use `npm install` to install dependencies necessary to build
a project.

Epack is simple stupid. It doesn't require you to add anything at all to your package.json and
gets out of the way to help you stay focused on what's important--your project. It runs many of
the commands you'd execute yourself such as `electron` and `webpack-dev-server` behind the scenes
speeding up your development process and saving you time. And it's configurable. (see ewebpack.json)

It's really just a build tool. At any time you can stop using Epack and still have a fully
working project.

# Getting started

Before using the `electron-webpacker` or the aliases `epacker` or `epack` (all do the same thing) commands you must install Epack.


## Install

Epack is on NPM. You can install it using the command below.

````bash
npm install electron-webpacker -g
````

or locally in the current project
````bash
npm install electron-webpacker
````

# Documentation

Epack is very lightweight. It's entire purpose is helping speed up the build and run process of
Electron + Webpack applications. We all know getting the work done is the best part not getting
caught up in the process of setup and scripts.

Adding Webpack to any project especially your Electron app adds a build step to your already existing build process further complicating it a bit. When starting your Electron app you must make sure your code has been compiled by Webpack and is built and ready to run. These are tasks you'd normally
do manually. Or clutter up your npm scripts with many commands.

Epack can help with that--saving you time.

It runs the commands for you loading in the Webpack config files in your project--just be
sure to tell it where those files reside. (see ewebpack.json).

Epack depends on many different CLI tools. `webpack-cli` `webpack-dev-server` `electron` `electron-builder` and `npm`.

If it cannot find any of these tools on the path env it will try to install them--it will not try and install NPM
it expects it to be available in environment.

Remember Epack has various aliases such as `epacker` and `epack` and the full version `electron-webpacker`.
When this article refers to `epack` you can use any of the aliases. They all do the same thing.

## Folder structure

Epack adheres to the standard Electron/Webpack folder structure. It uses this structure as a default. You
can structure your project as you wish. Epack forces no structure. Just be sure to tell it where your Webpack
configuration files are using ewebpack.json configuration file (see below)

The standard project structure Epack configures using `epack init .` is:

````bash
  .
  â”œâ”€â”€ src
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main
  â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.js
  â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ webpack.config.js
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ renderer
  â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ main.js
  â”‚       â””â”€â”€ webpack.config.js
  â”œâ”€â”€ dist
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.js
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ renderer.js
  â””â”€â”€ ewebpack.json

````

Add Webpack config settings for the Electron main and renderer process in the webpack.config.js file.
Epack will see any settings you add here and pass it on to Webpack.

## Init

Every project starts somewhere. Some Electron + Webpack tools require you to use `git clone [project]` to pull down
a boiler plate repo or download a quick start zip or maybe you manually put the files into
the right spot. With Epack, no need for all that non-sense, it's easy to get a base project started quick. Epack loads
a boiler plate setup into your project to help get you going fast and does the tedious part for you.

Run the command below in a project folder to initialize it as an Epack project.
`````bash
epack init
`````

or

````bash
epack init ../any-folder
````

By default, `epack init` will use the current folder '.' to initialize the project.


Example:

Running the command init:

````bash
epack init
````

Yields the output:

````bash
âžœ  project-folder epack init
info: Created directory src/main
info: Created directory src/renderer
info: Writing Electron main process: main.js @ src/main
info: Writing Electron renderer process: main.js @ src/renderer
info: Writing webpack.config.js files @ src/main src/renderer
````

## Build

The build command helps build your Webpack files for Electron's main and renderer process. It
will load in the webpack.config.js files (or the files specified in ewebpack.json, see ewebpack.json).
Then, it passes your Webpack config to `webpack-cli` building your source (starting at entry point)
into the configured 'dist/' folder. e.g., dist/main.js and dist/renderer.js

`````bash
epack build
`````
or

````bash
epack build ../any-folder
````

For example, running in project-folder:

````bash
epack build
````

yeilds the output,

````bash

## Run

The run command is a charm. This is the one you've been waiting for. The big shabooski. It uses `webpack-dev-server`
and `electron` CLI. It will run those CLI tools to pack up your Webpack main and renderer process. Then,
it runs `webpack-dev-server` to startup your Electron renderer process and runs `electron [src-folder]` to start
Electron. Put simply, it just starts your app and loads up the Electron window with your renderer process. It takes
advantage of hot-module-reload architecture (HMR) to dynamically reload your renderer.js process while you work in real time.

````bash
epack run
````

or

````bash
epack run ../any-folder/
````
For example, running command

````bash
epack run
````

Yeilds the following output

## Distribute

The dist command help you package up your application when you're ready to build for a targeted platform. It
uses `electron-builder` behind the scenes. Make sure you have a proper package.json file and follow the Documentation
required for Electron-builder.

It will use `webpack-cli` to load your Webpack configuration files and build them in production mode.

````bash
epack dist
````

or

````bash
epack dist ../any-folder
````

## MISC

Add `--verbose` to any command to add additional logging. Useful for tracking down issues with Epack before posting
an issue or asking for help.

````bash
epack init --verbose
````

You can run `--version` to get the version or `--help` if you're unsure about the commands to run.

## ewebpack.json (configuration)

Epack uses a configuration file to find what it needs to run, build, and distribute your project properly. If it
can't find it, it will use the defaults built into it and write the file to the current folder. You can change the settings
in this file at anytime. If you use the standard Epack folder structure, you won't need the ewebpack.json file
and can delete it.

````json
{
  "main": {
    "path": "src/main",
    "webpack-file": "webpack.config.js"
  },
  "renderer": {
    "path": "src/renderer",
    "webpack-file": "webpack.config.js"
  }
}
````

### main

`path` The path where your Webpack config file exists for the Electron main process.
The default value is src/main

`webpack-file` The name of the Webpack config file to load for the Electron main.
The default value is webpack.config.js

### renderer

`path` The path where your Webpack config file exists for the Electron renderer process.
The default value is src/renderer

`webpack-file` The name of the Webpack config file to load for the Electron renderer.
The default value is webpack.config.js

If Epack can't find these files, it can't do it's work proerly. At a bare minimum, you
must configure these paths properly. It will try to use the defaults if no ewebpack.json file
exists in the current project.

# Support

### General

If you have any problems with `epack` be sure to create an issue. Remember you can
run Epack in debug mode by adding `--verbose` to any command. This should provide more inforation
about what's going on. You will got a lot of information dumped back at you.

Most Epack related issues deal with Epack not finding the dependencies (CLI tools) it relies on
to do most of the work. This means the various CLI tools it runs. Make sure these are installed and
available on the path environment.

Happy Electron + Webpack dev.


# How to configure Webpack?

Epack is simple stupid. It's main purpose is to be lightweight and run fast. It's only
job is running the tools you need to get the job done. This is many of the already existing
cli tools such as `electron` `webpack-cli` `webpack-dev-server`. It passes your Webpack
config files onto these tools.

You configure Webpack as you would any other Webpack project. Your Webpack-file,
usually referered to as webpack.config.js, can be configured with every configuration
option available. Refer to the Webpack [configuration](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/) documentation
for more information on how to configure Webpack.

For example,

If you'd like to change the Webpack entry file for your Electron main process
open src/main/webpack.config (if you're following the standard folder structure, otherwise open your webpack file for your Electron main process).

Add the setting below to your Webpack file to modify the entry point.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  /*
   * This is just a webpack.config.js file see documentation for
   * configuration of Webpack.
   *
   * Below is the default options automatically applied when running
   *  `epack build`
   *
   * You can override any of the settings below. Settings defined below takes
   * preceedance. If these defaults aren't disired, simply change them.
   *
   */
  entry: "./main.js",
  // context: path.resolve(__dirname),
  // target: "electron-main",
  // mode: "development",
  // output: {
  //   filename: "./main.js"
  // },
  // node: {
  //   __dirname: false,
  //   __filename: false
  // }
};
```

## How does Electron talk to Webpack-Dev-Server?

In the boilerplate code generated by `epack init`, you'll see main.js inside `src/main`.

Inside this file, your electron main process (main.js) reads the environment variable
determining if it's running in "development" or "production". If it's running in
development, it swaps out the `loadURL(url)` with the URL that `webpack-dev-server` is
listening on hosting your renderer process.

Inside your Electron main process code you will find the following lines:

````javascript
// Create the browser window.
 const win = new BrowserWindow({
   width: 800,
   height: 600,
   webPreferences: {
     nodeIntegration: true
   }
 });
````
Above just creates a BrowserWindow in Electron setting the width and height.

````javascript
 var prodUrl = format({
   pathname: path.join(__dirname, "index.html"),
   protocol: 'file',
   slashes: true
 });
````

Above, we build the path for Electron "production". We won't have webpack-dev-server
serving our renderer process in production. We will need to load the minified
all packed up version of our application (static gen files).

````javascirpt
 var port = process.env.WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER_PORT || 9000;

 var url = process.env.NODE_ENV == "development"  ?
  `http://localhost:${port}/${process.env.WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER_PATH || "renderer"}` : prodUrl;

 console.log(`Loading URL @ ${url} for environment=${process.env.NODE_ENV}`);

 win.loadURL(url);
````
Above, we try and read the webpack-dev-server port provided as an ENV variable. If not provided,
we fall back to using port 9000. You can see when Electron is running in "development" it loads
the `webpack-dev-server` localhost url running on port 9000 (or configured port). Otherwise, it uses
the production URL. For Webpack and Electron to work together and make development easier, if you're
using webpack-dev-server during development, you'll want to be sure the `http://localhost:9000/renderer`
URL is loaded properly pointing to webpack-dev-server or you will see a blank page when electron loads
the window.


## Help my Electron window is blank?
Open your Electron main process (src/main/main.js), be sure to check the URL that is loading
into the window `win.loadURL(url)`. If Electron can't load this URL, you will see a blank screen.
Don't forget that Webpack-dev-server is running behind the scenes in "development" mode serving your
renderer process in real time with hot-module-reload (HMR). If you're running in "production" mode
webpack-dev-server isn't running. Instead your src/renderer/main.js process has been bundled up and
put in your 'dist' folder. Be sure your dist/ folder contains all the necessary files such as
index.html that Electron will try to load. There is also another setting you must enable in webpack.config.js
called `node: {__dirname: false}` in order for your Electron main process to resolve URLs properly
in production when `win.loadURL(url)` is called. These are standard Webpack config issues so be sure to read
the Webpack [configuration](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/) documentation page.
